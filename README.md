Fren is really enjoying watching this awesome movie- and wants to make his own! Create your own movie (while bootlegging a film at the theater) in Fren Makes a Movie!

Made by Trent (trent.cool) and Andrew (rampy.me)

## Instructions
Select a mic in settings first! (Press ESC if it doesn't show up at launch)
Using the camcorder, record a funny movie in the theater! Interact with objects and NPCs to set the stage for your cinematic masterpiece. When you are done, interact with the exit door (labeled AVFART) and see how many views your finished movie gets!

## Controls
This game has controller support, but some menus will require mouse input.
- WASD to move, Space to jump, Shift to TURBO sprint (if you feel too slow)
- Left click to interact with objects
- Hold right click to record with your camcorder
- Press R to drop/pick up your camcorder (it has a very cool unipod)
- Left/Right arrow keys to cycle through filters- these will appear in the final movie!
